# Welcome 

## Hello world, this is my first Jekyll blog post. 

### Where do I see myself at the end of our 16 week journey?

After completing the program, I hope to have a good foundation to start my career in web development and feel confident applying to jobs and navigating interviews.

### Where do I see myself in 6 months to 1 year?

By this point, I hope to have started at my first job in development.

### What I hope to accomplish in this journey.

I'd like to have a firm grasp on development fundamentals and actually understand what I'm doing instead of just scraping by. I understand it will be very difficult and when problems arise, I'd like to be able to figure them out by myself without relying on others to walk me through. As my instructor, you are already doing the most. Very helpful and attentive and for now, that's all I could ask for. Thank you.

## The End
